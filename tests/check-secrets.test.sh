#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/check-secrets.test.sh - drive check-secrets/check.py over the shapes
# the rule allows and the ones it must refuse.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The checker's whole value is that it says no, and a checker
# that says yes to everything is indistinguishable from a passing build. Each
# refusal below is a state some app in this portfolio was actually found in:
# six unreferenced credentials sitting in one host's secrets.env, a gate
# container reading the same secret file as its API, an env_file pointing at a
# path nobody could account for.
#
# The accept cases matter as much. A check that fires on a correct app gets an
# ignore comment within the week, so the two apps that already follow the rule
# exactly -- one delivering six secrets, one delivering two -- are pinned here
# as passing.
#
# Run: bash tests/check-secrets.test.sh

# SC2016 off for the whole file: the fixtures contain ${{ secrets.X }}, which
# is a GitHub expression and must reach the checker as those exact characters.
# Single quotes are the point, not an oversight.
