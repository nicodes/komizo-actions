# tests/setup-godot-inputs.test.sh - pin the exact shape of the setup-godot
# composite: the input default, the cache path and key, the env threading,
# and the caller-script invocation.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. setup-godot/ is two steps and ships no scripts of its own,
# so there is nothing here to execute -- what can drift is the action.yml
# itself, and every drift reaches the whole fleet the moment a product bumps
# its `uses:`. The cache path and GODOT_ARCHIVE_DIR must stay byte-equal or
# the archives land outside the directory the cache restores; the key must
# keep hashing the caller's script and release manifest or a reviewed Godot
# bump silently reuses the previous archive directory; and the run line must
# keep invoking the CALLER's tools/setup_godot.sh -- the day this action
# vendors its own copy, the drift it exists to kill is back.
#
# Run: bash tests/setup-godot-inputs.test.sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the needles below are LITERAL ${{ }} expressions
# from setup-godot/action.yml -- single quotes are the point, not a mistake.
