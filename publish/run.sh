# re-checks its own artifacts and remains authoritative.

#   PROJECT     project slug (validated)
#   REVISION    full 40-hex commit being released (validated)
#   COMPONENTS  space-separated image components (validated, allowlisted)

# and --components is nargs='+' so the space-separated list becomes one word
# per component. The expansion is unquoted on purpose -- quoting it would pass
# "api db" as a single component -- and is safe because every word passed the
# allowlist in validate.sh before this step could run.
